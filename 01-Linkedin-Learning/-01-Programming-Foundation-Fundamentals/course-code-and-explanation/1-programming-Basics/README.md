### Programming :

Programming is the process of converting ideas into instructions that a computer can understand and execute. These instructions are specific and sequential.

In Programming order matters, itâ€™s important to give the computers the right instructions and the correct sequence of steps to produce the desired result, otherwise we might introduce bugs or even make the computer crash.

### Bug :

A bug is when something unexpected happens.

---

### Crash :

A crash is when your program stops early or freezes

---

### Syntax :

A set of rules for writing a programming language, each language has its own syntax, or rules, and semantics

---

### Why do we have so many languages?

Because each comes with its own set of strengths and weaknesses. Some are ideal for programming small devices with limited memory, while others are made to handle complex mathematical computations.

---

### Source code :

It's the instructions we write for the computer to execute, and it's written in plain text. We write the source code without special formatting, like bold, italic, or different font types, and it can either be one line, or thousands. It just depends on the needs of your program.

For writing Source code, we use a text editor, because word processing applications aren't suitable for writing code, because by default, they insert bits of information in files that prevent them from being plain text.

Text Editors saves files with a .txt extension, By default. This is because it's plain text. But it's a best practice to use an extension that corresponds to the programming language that's inside of your file.

**Each programming language has its own file extensions !**

- JavaScript => .js
- Perl => .pl
- Kotlin => .kt
- python => .py

### Running your source code:

There are three main ways to translate source code into machine code:

- compiled
- interpreted
- combination of both

**Compiled languages: C, C++, and Objective-C**

They take your high level programming language and turn it into an executable that contains low level machine code. This way, users can run your code on their machine without ever needing your original source.

**Interpreted languages: PHP and Javascript**

They process your source code each times its run, line by line, and it's up to the other user to have the needed interpreter available on their machine

**Combination: Java, C# and Python**

### IDE (Integrated development environments) :

IDE is an application that provides you with special tools needed to write, debug, and compile code, IDEs comes with features that speed up your code development, such as line numbers, and syntax highlighting to important keywords and improve the readability of our code.

### IntelliSense:

A feature in **Vs Code** that allows you to get code suggestions while you're typing. It works like auto-complete.
